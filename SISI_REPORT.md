# SISI Report - AIM SDK Issues

## Issue: `secure()` Function Missing in Downloaded SDK

**Date Reported**: October 23, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: Python SDK (`sdks/python/aim_sdk/`)

### Problem Description

The `secure()` function is **not present** when the AIM SDK is downloaded by end users.

### Expected Behavior

According to the SDK documentation and test files (e.g., `sdk-testing/test_01_secure_function.py`), users should be able to use:

```python
from aim_sdk import secure

# ONE LINE - Complete enterprise security
agent = secure("my-agent")
```

### Current Behavior

While the `secure()` function is defined in the source code at `sdks/python/aim_sdk/__init__.py:37` as:

```python
secure = register_agent
```

This function is **not available** when users download and install the SDK.

### Impact

- **Critical user experience issue**: The advertised "one-line" registration feature doesn't work
- **Documentation mismatch**: All examples showing `secure()` will fail for users
- **Trust score impact**: Users cannot complete the basic "Stripe moment" workflow
- **Test failures**: `test_01_secure_function.py` will fail for end users

### Root Cause

Investigation needed to determine:
1. Is the SDK package being built correctly?
2. Are the exports in `__init__.py` being included in the distribution?
3. Is there a packaging/build configuration issue?

### Recommended Actions

1. ✅ Verify `secure` is in `__all__` export list in `__init__.py`
2. ✅ Check `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` configuration
3. ✅ Test SDK installation from PyPI (or local build)
4. ✅ Run `test_01_secure_function.py` with installed package (not source)
5. ✅ Update build/packaging configuration if needed

### Files Affected

- `sdks/python/aim_sdk/__init__.py` - Function definition
- `sdk-testing/test_01_secure_function.py` - Test expecting this function
- All documentation referencing `secure()` function
