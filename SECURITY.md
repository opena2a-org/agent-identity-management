# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Agent Identity Management (AIM) team takes security seriously. We appreciate the security research community's efforts in responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.

### Please Report Security Issues Responsibly

**DO NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**info@opena2a.org**

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us assess and address the vulnerability quickly, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact if exploited
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix it (optional)
- **Your Contact Information**: So we can follow up with questions

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Fix**: We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported to info@opena2a.org
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent to reporter
- **Day 3-7**: Assessment and severity determination
- **Day 7-30**: Development and testing of fix
- **Day 30-90**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix is deployed

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

## Supported Versions

We release security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

AIM includes the following security features:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Bcrypt Password Hashing**: Industry-standard password protection
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission management
- **OAuth/OIDC Support**: Enterprise SSO integration

### Cryptographic Security
- **Ed25519 Key Pairs**: Modern elliptic curve cryptography for agent identity
- **SHA-256 API Key Hashing**: Secure API key storage
- **Certificate Validation**: PKI infrastructure for agent verification
- **TLS/SSL**: Encrypted data in transit

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded secrets
- **Docker Security**: Non-root containers, minimal base images
- **Database Encryption**: Encrypted connections required
- **Secret Management**: Secure credential handling

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Always use HTTPS** in production
2. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
3. **Use strong passwords** for database and admin accounts
4. **Enable audit logging** for compliance
5. **Configure proper CORS** policies
6. **Use secrets management** solutions (not .env files in production)
7. **Regular security updates** - apply patches promptly

### For Development

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use .env.example** as template, never commit .env
3. **Run security scanners** before commits
4. **Review dependencies** for known vulnerabilities
5. **Follow least privilege** principle
6. **Validate all inputs** from users
7. **Test authentication** and authorization flows

## Security Audits

We conduct regular security assessments:

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes are reviewed
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security audits
- **Compliance Reviews**: SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR assessments

## Known Security Considerations

### Multi-Tenancy
- Organizations are strictly isolated at the database level
- API keys are scoped to specific organizations
- Users cannot access resources outside their organization

### API Security
- All API endpoints require authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

### Trust Scoring
- Trust scores use multiple factors to prevent gaming
- Historical data prevents sudden score manipulation
- ML models are trained on verified data

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as fixes are available. Subscribe to:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For critical vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Releases**: For all security updates
- **Mailing List**: info@opena2a.org

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow industry best practices for coordinated vulnerability disclosure:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report to info@opena2a.org
2. **Assessment**: We evaluate and respond within 48 hours
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test the fix
4. **Coordinated Release**: We coordinate public disclosure with reporter
5. **Public Advisory**: We publish security advisory after fix deployment

## Bug Bounty Program

We do not currently have a formal bug bounty program, but we:
- **Acknowledge** all valid security reports
- **Credit** researchers in security advisories
- **Fast-track** security fixes
- May consider **rewards** for critical vulnerabilities on a case-by-case basis

## Contact

- **Security Issues**: info@opena2a.org
- **General Security Questions**: Discuss in GitHub Discussions
- **Emergency Contact**: For critical vulnerabilities, mark email as URGENT

## Legal

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Follow this disclosure policy
- Act in good faith
- Do not violate privacy or destroy data
- Do not disrupt our services

Thank you for helping keep AIM and our users safe!
