---

### Layer 6: Performance Benchmarking
**Purpose**: Validate performance under production load

**Targets**:
- API Response: p50 < 50ms, p95 < 100ms, p99 < 200ms
- Throughput: 1000+ requests/second
- Concurrent Users: 1000+ simultaneous connections

**Documentation**: [docs/layer-6-performance.md](./docs/layer-6-performance.md)

**Deliverable**: Performance benchmark report

---

### Layer 7: Staging Deployment
**Purpose**: Validate production deployment process

**Environment**: Azure Container Apps (identical to production)

**Validation**:
- Automated deployment
- Database migrations
- Health checks
- Monitoring & logging
- SSL/TLS configuration

## 📞 Escalation Path

**Blocker**: Quality gate fails
**Action**: Document issue → Assign owner → Fix → Re-test → Sign off

**Critical Issues**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, performance showstoppers
**Escalation**: Immediate halt → Root cause analysis → Fix verification → Resume

---
