# üöÄ Production Readiness - Quick Start Guide

**Goal**: Validate AIM to Silicon Valley standards before open-source release

**Timeline**: 7-10 days systematic validation

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

```bash
# Required tools
‚úÖ Go 1.23+        (backend tests)
‚úÖ Node.js 22+     (frontend tests)
‚úÖ Docker Desktop  (integration tests)
‚úÖ k6             (performance tests)
‚úÖ PostgreSQL 16   (local development)

# Optional tools (recommended)
‚≠ê nancy          (dependency scanning)
‚≠ê trivy          (container scanning)
‚≠ê OWASP ZAP      (security testing)
```

Install missing tools:
```bash
# macOS
brew install go node docker k6
brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy

# Nancy for Go dependency scanning
go install github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy@latest
```

---

## Day-by-Day Execution Plan

### Day 1-2: Code Audit (Layer 1)

**Objective**: Verify all 100+ endpoints use real implementation (no mocks).

```bash
cd production-readiness

# Run automated audit helper
./scripts/audit-endpoints.sh

# Manual audit (required)
# 1. Open: reports/code-audit-report.md
# 2. For each endpoint, trace: Handler ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Database
# 3. Mark as: ‚úÖ Real | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚ùå Mocked
# 4. Fix any issues found
# 5. Update summary statistics
```

**Deliverable**: Complete audit report with 100% real implementation.

---

### Day 2-3: Unit Testing (Layer 2)

**Objective**: Achieve 90%+ test coverage for all business logic.

```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
./scripts/run-unit-tests.sh

# View coverage report
open reports/coverage.html

# If coverage < 90%, write more tests:
cd ../apps/backend/internal/application
# Create *_test.go files for any untested services
```

**Deliverable**: 90%+ coverage, all tests passing.

---

### Day 3-4: Integration Testing (Layer 3)

**Objective**: Test all 100+ endpoints with real database.

```bash
# Run integration tests (starts Docker containers automatically)
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh

# Tests will:
# 1. Start PostgreSQL + Redis in Docker
# 2. Run migrations
# 3. Test all endpoints
# 4. Clean up
```

**Deliverable**: 100% endpoint coverage verified.

---

### Day 5: End-to-End Testing (Layer 4)

**Objective**: Test complete user journeys.

```bash
# Backend E2E tests
cd tests/e2e
go test -v -tags=e2e ./...

# Frontend E2E tests (Playwright)
cd ../../apps/web
npx playwright test

# View test report
npx playwright show-report
```

**Deliverable**: All critical user journeys validated.

---

### Day 6: Security Validation (Layer 5)

**Objective**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Run automated security scans
./scripts/security-scan.sh

# Review findings
cat reports/security-report.md

# Manual OWASP Top 10 testing
# Follow: docs/layer-5-security.md
```

**Deliverable**: Security audit report, zero critical issues.

---

### Day 7: Performance Benchmarking (Layer 6)

**Objective**: Validate p95 latency < 100ms, 1000+ concurrent users.

```bash
# Start backend locally
cd ../apps/backend
go run cmd/server/main.go &

# Run performance tests
cd ../../production-readiness
./scripts/performance-test.sh

# View results
cat reports/performance-report.md
```

**Deliverable**: Performance targets met.

---

### Day 8-9: Staging Deployment (Layer 7)

**Objective**: Deploy to Azure staging, validate production readiness.

```bash
# Deploy to Azure staging
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh

# Run smoke tests
./scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh https://aim-staging-backend.*.azurecontainerapps.io

# Monitor for 24 hours
# Check: Application Insights dashboard
```

**Deliverable**: Staging environment stable for 24+ hours.

---

### Day 10: Final Validation & Documentation

**Objective**: Complete all quality gates, prepare for release.

```bash
# Final checklist review
open checklists/production-readiness-checklist.md

# Verify all layers complete:
‚úÖ Layer 1: Code Audit
‚úÖ Layer 2: Unit Testing
‚úÖ Layer 3: Integration Testing
‚úÖ Layer 4: E2E Testing
‚úÖ Layer 5: Security Validation
‚úÖ Layer 6: Performance Benchmarking
‚úÖ Layer 7: Staging Deployment

# Update documentation
# - README.md
# - API docs
# - Deployment guides
```

**Deliverable**: Production-ready AIM platform! üéâ

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Tests fail locally
```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env

# Verify database running
psql -h localhost -U postgres -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check ports not in use
lsof -i :8080  # Backend
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
```

### Issue: Performance tests fail
```bash
# Increase database connection pool
# Edit: apps/backend/internal/config/config.go
# Change: MaxConnections from 50 to 100

# Add database indexes for slow queries
# Check: docs/layer-6-performance.md
```

### Issue: Docker Compose won't start
```bash
# Clean up old containers
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -a

# Restart Docker Desktop
# Try again
```
