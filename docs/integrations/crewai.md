# 🤝 CrewAI Integration - Secure Multi-Agent Teams

Secure your entire CrewAI crew with **3 lines of code**.

## What You'll Build

A multi-agent CrewAI team that:
- ✅ Multiple specialized agents working together
- ✅ Automatically secured with AIM (3 lines of code)
- ✅ Complete audit trail of all agent actions
- ✅ Real-time trust scoring for each agent
- ✅ Team-level security monitoring

**Integration Time**: 5 minutes
**Code Changes**: 3 lines
**Use Case**: Multi-agent workflows (research teams, content creation, business intelligence)

---

## Prerequisites

1. ✅ AIM platform running ([Quick Start Guide](../quick-start.md))
2. ✅ CrewAI installed (`pip install crewai crewai-tools`)
3. ✅ `aim-sdk` installed (`pip install aim-sdk`)
4. ✅ OpenAI API key (for LLM)

---

## Integration Pattern

### Before (Unsecured CrewAI)

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Research and gather information",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool]
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write engaging content",
    tools=[write_tool]
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[research_task, write_task])

# Run crew (no security, no audit trail)
result = crew.kickoff()
```

### After (Secured with AIM) - Just 3 Lines

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from aim_sdk import secure  # ← Line 1
from aim_sdk.integrations.crewai import AIMCrewWrapper  # ← Line 2

# Register crew with AIM
aim_crew = secure("research-crew")  # ← Line 3

# Define agents (same as before)
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Research and gather information",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool]
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write engaging content",
    tools=[write_tool]
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[research_task, write_task])

# Wrap crew with AIM security
secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)

# Run crew (fully secured and monitored)
result = secured_crew.kickoff()
# ✅ Every agent action verified and logged
```

**What Changes?**
- **Before**: No security, no audit trail, no visibility
- **After**: Complete visibility, audit trail, trust scoring, security alerts

## 🎓 Understanding the Integration

### What Does `AIMCrewWrapper` Do?

```python
secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)
```

Behind this wrapper, AIM:
1. ✅ Intercepts all agent actions (tool calls, delegations)
2. ✅ Verifies each action with cryptographic signatures
3. ✅ Logs complete audit trail (who did what, when)
4. ✅ Monitors for anomalies across all agents
5. ✅ Calculates team-level trust score
6. ✅ Triggers security alerts if needed

### How Are Crew Actions Verified?

Every time an agent in your crew acts:
```python
# Researcher uses search tool
researcher.execute_task(research_task)
  → search_tool("AI healthcare 2025")
```

AIM automatically:
1. **Captures** the action context (agent, tool, parameters)
2. **Signs** the action with Ed25519 private key
3. **Verifies** the signature with AIM platform
4. **Logs** the action with full context
5. **Updates** trust score for the crew
6. **Monitors** for behavioral drift

**Zero code changes to your agents!**

### Team-Level Trust Scoring

Your crew's trust score (0.93) reflects:

1. **Verification Status** (25%): All agent actions verified
2. **Uptime** (15%): Crew always responsive
3. **Success Rate** (15%): 96% of actions succeeded (22/23)
4. **Security Alerts** (15%): Zero alerts
5. **Compliance** (10%): Following all policies
6. **Age** (10%): New crew (improves over time)
7. **Drift Detection** (5%): Consistent behavior patterns
8. **User Feedback** (5%): No negative feedback

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Multi-Crew Coordination

```python
from aim_sdk import secure
from aim_sdk.integrations.crewai import AIMCrewWrapper
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Register multiple crews
research_crew_aim = secure("research-crew")
marketing_crew_aim = secure("marketing-crew")

# Define crews
research_crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, analyst], tasks=[research_tasks])
marketing_crew = Crew(agents=[marketer, designer], tasks=[marketing_tasks])

# Secure both crews
secured_research = AIMCrewWrapper(research_crew, aim_agent=research_crew_aim)
secured_marketing = AIMCrewWrapper(marketing_crew, aim_agent=marketing_crew_aim)

# Run crews (both monitored separately)
research_result = secured_research.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI Trends"})
marketing_result = secured_marketing.kickoff(inputs={"product": research_result})

# Dashboard shows both crews separately with individual trust scores
```

### Hierarchical Process

```python
from crewai import Process

# Create crew with hierarchical process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task, editing_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # Manager delegates tasks
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
)

# Secure the hierarchical crew
secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)

# AIM tracks delegation patterns and manager decisions
result = secured_crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "Quantum Computing"})
```

### Custom Callbacks

```python
from aim_sdk.integrations.crewai import AIMCrewWrapper

def on_agent_action(agent_name: str, action: str, result: str):
    """Custom callback for each agent action"""
    print(f"[{agent_name}] {action} → {result[:50]}...")

# Secure crew with custom callbacks
secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(
    crew,
    aim_agent=aim_crew,
    on_action=on_agent_action
)

result = secured_crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "Blockchain"})
# Prints each action as it happens
```

---

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Content Creation Pipeline

```python
from aim_sdk import secure
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

aim_crew = secure("content-pipeline")

# Content crew
researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Research topics", tools=[search_tool])
writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Write articles", tools=[write_tool])
seo_optimizer = Agent(role="SEO Expert", goal="Optimize for SEO", tools=[seo_tool])
publisher = Agent(role="Publisher", goal="Publish content", tools=[cms_tool])

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, seo_optimizer, publisher],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task, seo_task, publish_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)

# Run pipeline (fully audited)
result = secured_crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI in 2025"})
```

### 2. Business Intelligence Team

```python
from aim_sdk import secure
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

aim_crew = secure("bi-team")

# BI crew
data_analyst = Agent(role="Data Analyst", goal="Analyze data", tools=[sql_tool])
statistician = Agent(role="Statistician", goal="Statistical analysis", tools=[stats_tool])
visualizer = Agent(role="Data Viz Expert", goal="Create charts", tools=[viz_tool])
presenter = Agent(role="Presenter", goal="Create presentation", tools=[ppt_tool])

crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst, statistician, visualizer, presenter],
    tasks=[analyze_task, stats_task, viz_task, present_task]
)

secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)

# Run BI pipeline
report = secured_crew.kickoff(inputs={"dataset": "Q4_sales.csv"})
```

### 3. Customer Support Crew

```python
from aim_sdk import secure
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

aim_crew = secure("support-crew")

# Support crew
ticket_analyzer = Agent(role="Ticket Analyzer", goal="Categorize tickets", tools=[nlp_tool])
knowledge_base = Agent(role="KB Searcher", goal="Find solutions", tools=[kb_tool])
responder = Agent(role="Support Agent", goal="Draft responses", tools=[email_tool])
quality_checker = Agent(role="QA", goal="Review responses", tools=[qa_tool])

crew = Crew(
    agents=[ticket_analyzer, knowledge_base, responder, quality_checker],
    tasks=[analyze_task, search_task, respond_task, qa_task]
)

secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)

# Process support ticket
response = secured_crew.kickoff(inputs={"ticket_id": "T-12345"})
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Agent not found in AIM"

**Error**: `AIMError: Agent 'research-crew' not registered`

**Solution**:
1. Register crew in AIM dashboard first
2. Verify `AIM_PRIVATE_KEY` is set correctly
3. Check AIM backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`

### Issue: "CrewAI tools not verified"

**Error**: `Tool execution not logged in AIM`

**Solution**:
- Ensure you're using `AIMCrewWrapper`, not plain `Crew`
- Verify wrapper initialization: `secured_crew = AIMCrewWrapper(crew, aim_agent=aim_crew)`
- Check AIM dashboard for connection status

### Issue: "Low trust score for crew"

**Symptoms**: Trust score below 0.70

**Common Causes**:
1. **High failure rate**: Some agents failing frequently
2. **Anomalies detected**: Unusual behavior patterns
3. **Security alerts**: Suspicious tool usage

**Solution**:
```python
# Check crew status in dashboard
# Review failed actions in audit trail
# Investigate agents with low success rates
# Check for tools being misused
```
