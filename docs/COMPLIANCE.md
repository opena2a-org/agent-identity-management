## Overview

AIM (Agent Identity Management) is designed to meet the **most stringent enterprise compliance requirements**, including SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001. This document provides comprehensive guidance on:

- Maintaining compliance with industry standards
- Generating audit reports for compliance officers
- Implementing data retention and privacy policies
- Conducting regular compliance audits
- Responding to compliance inquiries

### Compliance Philosophy

**"Compliance by Design"** - AIM embeds compliance controls directly into the system architecture rather than treating compliance as an afterthought.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Transparency**: Every action is logged and auditable
2. **Privacy**: User data is protected by default
3. **Control**: Fine-grained access controls with RBAC
4. **Auditability**: Immutable audit trail for all operations
5. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility tracking

## Audit Trail

### Comprehensive Audit Logging

AIM logs **every action** across the platform:

**Logged Events**:
- User authentication (login, logout, token refresh)
- User management (create, update, delete, role change)
- Agent operations (create, update, delete, verify)
- MCP server operations (register, update, delete, verify)
- API key operations (create, revoke, use)
- Security events (threats, alerts, blocks)
- Configuration changes (settings, policies)
- Data access (view, export, download)

### Audit Log Structure

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T14:30:00Z",
  "organization_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "action": "create|update|delete|view|verify|grant|revoke|suspend|acknowledge",
  "resource_type": "user|agent|mcp_server|api_key|threat|alert",
  "resource_id": "uuid",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "status": "success|failure",
  "error_message": "optional error details",
  "metadata": {
    "agent_name": "production-agent-1",
    "trust_score": 87.5,
    "custom_field": "additional context"
  }
}
```

### Immutable Audit Trail

**Audit logs are append-only** and cannot be modified or deleted:

```go
// Audit service implementation
func (s *AuditService) LogAction(
    ctx context.Context,
    orgID, userID uuid.UUID,
    action, resourceType string,
    resourceID uuid.UUID,
    sourceIP, userAgent string,
    metadata map[string]interface{},
) error {
    log := &domain.AuditLog{
        ID:            uuid.New(),
        Timestamp:     time.Now(),
        OrganizationID: orgID,
        UserID:        userID,
        Action:        action,
        ResourceType:  resourceType,
        ResourceID:    resourceID,
        SourceIP:      sourceIP,
        UserAgent:     userAgent,
        Metadata:      metadata,
    }

    // Append-only insert (no updates or deletes allowed)
    return s.repo.Create(ctx, log)
}
```

### Audit Log Query API

```bash
# Get audit logs with filters
GET /api/v1/audit-logs?
  start=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&
  end=2025-12-31T23:59:59Z&
  user_id=uuid&
  action=create&
  resource_type=agent&
  limit=100

Response:
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-10T14:30:00Z",
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "action": "create",
      "resource_type": "agent",
      "resource_id": "uuid",
      "metadata": {...}
    }
  ],
  "total": 1523,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 100
}
```

## Data Retention & Privacy

### Data Retention Policies

| Data Type | Retention Period | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| User Account Data | Until account deletion | Contract requirement |
| Audit Logs | 1 year | Compliance, security investigation |
| Security Threat Logs | 2 years | Long-term threat analysis |
| API Keys (active) | Until revocation | Operational requirement |
| API Keys (revoked) | 90 days | Compliance, investigation |
| Deleted User Data | 30 days (soft delete) | GDPR grace period |
| Session Tokens | 24 hours (access), 7 days (refresh) | Security best practice |

### Automated Data Retention

**Daily Cleanup Job**:
```go
// Run daily at 2 AM UTC
func cleanupExpiredData() {
    // Delete audit logs older than 1 year
    deleteAuditLogs(time.Now().AddDate(-1, 0, 0))

    // Delete security threat logs older than 2 years
    deleteSecurityThreats(time.Now().AddDate(-2, 0, 0))

    // Permanently delete soft-deleted users after 30 days
    permanentlyDeleteUsers(time.Now().AddDate(0, 0, -30))

    // Delete revoked API keys after 90 days
    deleteRevokedAPIKeys(time.Now().AddDate(0, 0, -90))

    // Delete expired session tokens
    deleteExpiredTokens(time.Now())
}
```

### Privacy Protection

**Personal Data Minimization**:
- Only collect data necessary for operation
- No tracking cookies or analytics by default
- Optional telemetry (opt-in only)

**Data Anonymization**:
```go
// Anonymize audit logs when user is deleted
func anonymizeUserLogs(userID uuid.UUID) {
    logs := getAuditLogsByUser(userID)

    for _, log := range logs {
        log.UserID = uuid.Nil // Remove user identifier
        log.SourceIP = "0.0.0.0" // Remove IP address
        log.Metadata["anonymized"] = true
        updateAuditLog(log)
    }
}
```
