## Understanding AIM Authentication

AIM uses a **dual authentication model**:

### 1. OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)
- **Purpose**: Authenticate users accessing the platform
- **Flow**: Microsoft/Google OAuth → JWT access/refresh tokens
- **Used For**: Dashboard access, SDK downloads

### 2. Ed25519 Cryptographic Signing (Agent Authentication)
- **Purpose**: Authenticate agents performing actions
- **Flow**: Agent signs requests with private key
- **Used For**: Verification requests, action logging

### Combined Model

```
User (OAuth) → Downloads SDK → Agent (Ed25519 + OAuth)
```

An agent needs BOTH:
- ✅ OAuth tokens (from user's SDK download)
- ✅ Ed25519 keys (generated during agent registration)

---

## Token Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Initial Authentication

```
1. User logs in via OAuth (Google/Microsoft)
   → Backend issues access_token (1 hour TTL)
   → Backend issues refresh_token (90 days TTL)
   → Tokens stored in session/cookies

2. User downloads SDK
   → SDK includes current refresh_token
   → SDK includes sdk_token_id for tracking

3. Agent registers using secure()
   → SDK uses refresh_token to get access_token
   → Agent generates Ed25519 keypair
   → Public key sent to backend
   → Agent gets agent_id
```

### Phase 2: Active Use

```
4. Agent requests verification
   → SDK checks: access_token expired?
   → If expired: refresh using refresh_token
   → Backend returns NEW access_token + NEW refresh_token
   → SDK auto-saves NEW refresh_token (token rotation)
   → OLD refresh_token revoked in database

5. Verification request sent
   → Signed with Ed25519 private key
   → Includes access_token in header
   → Backend validates both signature AND token
```

### Phase 3: Token Rotation (Security Feature)

```
6. Every token refresh triggers rotation
   → refresh_token_v1 → refresh_token_v2
   → refresh_token_v1 marked as revoked
   → Only refresh_token_v2 works now

7. If refresh_token_v1 is used again
   → Backend returns 401 Unauthorized
   → Security alert generated
   → This indicates potential token theft
```

## Common Authentication Errors

### Error 1: "Token Expired" (Status: 401)

**Full Error**:
```
❌ Authentication Failed: Token Expired

Your SDK credentials have expired due to token rotation (security policy).

To fix this issue:
  1. Log in to AIM portal: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
  2. Download fresh SDK: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/sdk
  3. Copy new credentials to ~/.aim/credentials.json
```

**Root Cause**: Refresh token has been rotated/revoked.

**When This Happens**:
- After using SDK from multiple locations
- After long period of inactivity
- After token manually revoked by admin
- After security incident (automatic revocation)

**How to Fix**:

```bash
# Step 1: Log in to portal
open http://localhost:3000/auth/login

# Step 2: Download fresh SDK
# Click "Download SDK" in dashboard

# Step 3: Extract and copy credentials
unzip aim-sdk-python.zip
cp -r aim-sdk-python/.aim ~/.aim/

# Step 4: Verify credentials structure
cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | python -m json.tool

# Expected structure:
{
  "refresh_token": "...",      # Root level (OAuth)
  "sdk_token_id": "...",       # Root level (OAuth)
  "aim_url": "http://...",
  "your-agent": {
    "agent_id": "...",
    "private_key": "...",      # Agent level (Ed25519)
    "public_key": "..."
  }
}

# Step 5: Test authentication
python -c "
from aim_sdk import secure
client = secure('your-agent')
print(f'✅ Authenticated: {client.agent_id}')
"
```

**Prevention**:
- Don't copy credentials between machines
- Download separate SDK for each environment
- Let SDK handle token rotation automatically

---

### Error 2: "Invalid Credentials" (Status: 401)

**Full Error**:
```
❌ Authentication Failed: Invalid credentials format

Your agent credentials appear to be invalid or corrupted.
```

**Root Cause**: Credentials file is malformed or incomplete.

**Diagnostic Steps**:

```bash
# 1. Check file exists
ls -la ~/.aim/credentials.json
# Expected: -rw------- (permissions 600)

# 2. Validate JSON structure
python -m json.tool ~/.aim/credentials.json
# Should print formatted JSON, no errors

# 3. Check required fields
cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | jq 'keys'
# Expected: ["refresh_token", "sdk_token_id", "aim_url", "your-agent-name"]

# 4. Verify OAuth tokens present
cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | jq '. | has("refresh_token")'
# Expected: true

# 5. Verify agent keys present
cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | jq '.["your-agent"] | has("private_key")'
# Expected: true
```

**Common Issues**:

#### Issue A: Missing OAuth Tokens

```json
// ❌ WRONG - no OAuth tokens at root
{
  "your-agent": {
    "agent_id": "...",
    "private_key": "...",
    "public_key": "..."
  }
}

// ✅ CORRECT - OAuth tokens at root
{
  "refresh_token": "...",  // Added
  "sdk_token_id": "...",   // Added
  "your-agent": {
    "agent_id": "...",
    "private_key": "...",
    "public_key": "..."
  }
}
```

**Fix**: Download fresh SDK (contains both OAuth + agent keys)

#### Issue B: Corrupted Private Key

```bash
# Check private key format
cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | jq '.["your-agent"].private_key'

# Should be base64-encoded Ed25519 key
# Length: ~88 characters
# Example: "MC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEIGHxX..."

# If corrupted (wrong length, invalid chars):
# Download fresh SDK
```

#### Issue C: Wrong Agent Name

```python
# Code says:
client = secure("my-agent")

# But credentials.json has:
{
  "different-agent-name": { ... }  # Mismatch!
}

# Fix: Use correct agent name OR re-register
```

---

### Error 3: "Signature Verification Failed" (Status: 401)

**Full Error**:
```
❌ Authentication Failed: Invalid signature

Request signature verification failed.
```

**Root Cause**: Ed25519 signature invalid.

**Possible Causes**:

#### 1. Private Key Mismatch

```bash
# Check if public key in backend matches local private key

# Get agent's public key from backend
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/agents/YOUR_AGENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" | jq -r '.public_key'

# Get public key from credentials
cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | jq -r '.["your-agent"].public_key'

# Should be IDENTICAL

# If different:
# - Private key was regenerated
# - Or agent re-registered with different keys
# Fix: Download fresh SDK
```

#### 2. Request Tampering

```python
# ❌ Don't modify request after signing
request = client.sign_request(data)
request['data'] = 'modified'  # Signature now invalid!

# ✅ Sign the final request
final_data = {'action': 'search'}
request = client.sign_request(final_data)  # Don't modify after
```

#### 3. Clock Skew

```bash
# Check system time
date

# Sync with NTP
sudo ntpdate -s time.apple.com  # Mac
sudo ntpdate -s pool.ntp.org    # Linux

# Restart agent after time sync
```

---

### Error 4: "Access Token Expired" (Status: 401)

**Full Error**:
```
⚠️  Warning: Access token expired
```

**Root Cause**: Access token expired (1 hour TTL).

**Expected Behavior**: SDK should automatically refresh.

**If SDK Doesn't Refresh**:

```python
# Debug: Check if SDK has refresh token
from aim_sdk.oauth import OAuthTokenManager

manager = OAuthTokenManager()
print(f"Has credentials: {manager.has_credentials()}")
print(f"Has refresh token: {'refresh_token' in manager.credentials}")

# If False:
# - Credentials not loaded
# - Or refresh_token missing
# Fix: Download fresh SDK
```

**Manual Refresh** (for debugging):

```python
from aim_sdk.oauth import OAuthTokenManager

manager = OAuthTokenManager()
access_token = manager.get_access_token()

if access_token:
    print(f"✅ Access token refreshed")
else:
    print(f"❌ Refresh failed - check credentials")
```

---

### Error 5: "Agent is not permitted to authenticate" (Status: 401)

**Full Error**:
```
❌ Authentication Failed: Agent is not permitted to authenticate (status: revoked)
```

**Root Cause**: The signature or API key is valid, but the agent itself is no
longer allowed to authenticate. Only agents in `pending` or `verified` status may
authenticate; `suspended` and `revoked` are refused, as is any other status value.

This applies to every agent auth path — Ed25519, ML-DSA, hybrid, and API keys.
Rotating the key or re-signing the request will not help, because the key is not
what was rejected.

**Possible Causes**:

#### 1. The agent was revoked

Someone called `DELETE /api/v1/agents/{id}`, or revoked it from the dashboard.

```bash
# Check the agent's current status
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/agents/YOUR_AGENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" | jq '.status'
```

Revoked agents are retained for 30 days before cleanup and can be reinstated in
that window. Reinstating is a privileged action — ask an organization admin.

#### 2. The agent was suspended by key expiry

Agents whose signing key passed its expiry and its rotation grace period are
suspended automatically. This is the common cause when nobody remembers revoking
anything.

```bash
# Was it a key-expiry suspension? A keyExpiresAt in the past alongside
# status "suspended" is the signature of this case.
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/agents/YOUR_AGENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  | jq '{status, keyExpiresAt, keyCreatedAt, rotationCount}'
```

**Fix**: rotate the signing key, then have an admin reinstate the agent. Rotating
on a schedule ahead of `keyExpiresAt` avoids the suspension entirely.

#### 3. An API key still works but its agent does not

An API key carries its own `is_active` flag, but it authenticates *as an agent*.
If that agent is revoked or suspended, the key is refused even while it is active
and unexpired — the key is not the thing being denied.

```bash
# The key's own state and its agent's state are two different questions
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.apiKeys[] | {name, isActive, expiresAt, agentId, agentName}'
```

Then check that `agentId` against Cause 1. A key showing `isActive: true` with a
future `expiresAt` still fails if its agent is suspended or revoked.

## Advanced Diagnostics

### Check Token Status in Database

```sql
-- Connect to database
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -U postgres -d identity

-- Check your SDK token status
SELECT
  token_id,
  device_name,
  created_at,
  last_used_at,
  revoked_at IS NULL as is_active,
  revoke_reason
FROM sdk_tokens
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Result interpretation:
-- is_active = true  → Token is valid
-- is_active = false → Token has been revoked (normal after rotation)
```

### Trace Token Rotation Chain

```sql
-- See token rotation history
WITH RECURSIVE token_chain AS (
  -- Start with current token
  SELECT
    token_id,
    rotated_from_token_id,
    created_at,
    revoked_at,
    1 as depth
  FROM sdk_tokens
  WHERE token_id = 'YOUR_CURRENT_TOKEN_ID'

  UNION ALL

  -- Follow rotation chain backwards
  SELECT
    t.token_id,
    t.rotated_from_token_id,
    t.created_at,
    t.revoked_at,
    tc.depth + 1
  FROM sdk_tokens t
  JOIN token_chain tc ON t.token_id = tc.rotated_from_token_id
  WHERE tc.depth < 10  -- Limit recursion
)
SELECT
  depth,
  token_id,
  created_at,
  revoked_at IS NULL as still_active
FROM token_chain
ORDER BY depth;

-- Shows complete rotation history back to original SDK download
```

### Monitor Token Refresh Attempts

```bash
# Watch backend logs for token refresh
docker logs -f identity-backend | grep "refresh"

# Look for:
# ✅ "Token refresh successful"
# ❌ "Token refresh failed: invalid token"
# 🔄 "Token rotated: old_token → new_token"
```

### Test Authentication Flow

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Test complete authentication flow"""

from aim_sdk import secure
from aim_sdk.oauth import OAuthTokenManager
import time

print("=== AIM Authentication Test ===\n")

# Step 1: Check credentials exist
print("1. Checking credentials...")
manager = OAuthTokenManager()
if not manager.has_credentials():
    print("❌ No credentials found")
    print("   Download SDK from portal")
    exit(1)
print("✅ Credentials found")

# Step 2: Test token refresh
print("\n2. Testing token refresh...")
access_token = manager.get_access_token()
if not access_token:
    print("❌ Token refresh failed")
    print("   Token may be expired/revoked")
    exit(1)
print(f"✅ Access token obtained: {access_token[:20]}...")

# Step 3: Test agent registration/login
print("\n3. Testing agent authentication...")
try:
    client = secure("test-agent")
    print(f"✅ Agent authenticated: {client.agent_id}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Agent authentication failed: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Step 4: Test verification flow
print("\n4. Testing verification flow...")
try:
    verification = client.verify_capability(
        capability="test:action",
        resource="test_resource",
        context={"test": True}
    )
    if verification and 'audit_id' in verification:
        print(f"✅ Verification successful: {verification['audit_id']}")
    else:
        print(f"⚠️  Verification returned unexpected response")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Verification failed: {e}")
    exit(1)

print("\n=== All Tests Passed ===")
```

## Security Considerations

### Token Storage Security

**Credentials File Permissions**:
```bash
# MUST be 600 (owner read/write only)
chmod 600 ~/.aim/credentials.json

# Verify
ls -la ~/.aim/credentials.json
# Should show: -rw------- (600)

# If not:
sudo chmod 600 ~/.aim/credentials.json
sudo chown $USER ~/.aim/credentials.json
```

**Never**:
- ❌ Commit credentials to Git
- ❌ Share credentials via email/Slack
- ❌ Store credentials in public locations
- ❌ Use credentials from untrusted sources

**Always**:
- ✅ Use file permissions 600
- ✅ Download SDK from official portal
- ✅ Rotate credentials after security incidents
- ✅ Use separate credentials per environment

### Detecting Token Theft

**Signs of Compromised Tokens**:

1. **Multiple Failed Refresh Attempts**
   ```sql
   -- Check for suspicious activity
   SELECT
     token_id,
     COUNT(*) as failed_attempts
   FROM audit_logs
   WHERE event_type = 'token_refresh_failed'
     AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   GROUP BY token_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
   ```

2. **Revoked Token Usage**
   ```sql
   -- Alerts for using revoked tokens (suspicious!)
   SELECT
     token_id,
     user_id,
     attempted_at,
     source_ip
   FROM security_alerts
   WHERE alert_type = 'revoked_token_usage'
     AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
   ```

3. **Unusual Geographic Locations**
   ```sql
   -- Token used from different IPs/locations
   SELECT
     token_id,
     COUNT(DISTINCT source_ip) as unique_ips,
     array_agg(DISTINCT source_ip) as ips
   FROM token_usage_logs
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   GROUP BY token_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT source_ip) > 2;
   ```

**Immediate Response**:
```bash
# Revoke all tokens for a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/revoke-user-tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"user_id": "COMPROMISED_USER_ID"}'

# Force password reset
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/force-password-reset \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"user_id": "COMPROMISED_USER_ID"}'

# Notify user
# Investigate source of compromise
# Review access logs
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why do I need to download SDK repeatedly?

**A**: You don't, normally. If you're downloading SDK frequently, something is wrong:

**Normal**: Download SDK once per environment, use continuously
**Problem**: Downloading daily/weekly indicates token rotation issues

**Root Causes**:
- Using SDK from multiple locations (tokens conflict)
- Copying credentials between machines
- Manual token manipulation

**Solution**: Use SDK from ONE location, let it handle rotation automatically.

---

### Q: Can I extend token lifetime?

**A**: Token lifetimes are security-mandated:

- **Access Token**: 1 hour (cannot extend - security requirement)
- **Refresh Token**: 90 days (can configure, but not recommended)

**Why Short TTL**:
- Limits damage if token stolen
- Forces regular re-authentication
- Meets compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA)

**If You Need Longer**:
- Use API keys (no expiration, different security model)
- Use service accounts with API keys
- OAuth tokens MUST have short TTL for security

---

### Q: What if I'm debugging and need stable tokens?

**A**: For development/debugging:

**Option 1**: Use API Keys (no rotation)
```python
client = AIMClient(
    agent_id="...",
    api_key="your-api-key",  # No token rotation
    aim_url="..."
)
```

**Option 2**: Use Test Environment
```bash
# Set up test environment with relaxed policies
export AIM_ENV=development
export TOKEN_ROTATION_ENABLED=false  # Dev only!
```

**Option 3**: Download Fresh SDK Each Session
```bash
# Automated script
./dev/get-fresh-tokens.sh
```

**Never Disable in Production**: Token rotation is required for security.

## Summary

### Quick Checklist for Auth Issues

- [ ] Backend running? (`curl http://localhost:8080/health`)
- [ ] Credentials exist? (`ls ~/.aim/credentials.json`)
- [ ] Credentials valid JSON? (`python -m json.tool ~/.aim/credentials.json`)
- [ ] Has refresh_token? (`cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | grep refresh_token`)
- [ ] Has private_key? (`cat ~/.aim/credentials.json | jq '.["agent-name"].private_key'`)
- [ ] Correct permissions? (`ls -la ~/.aim/credentials.json` → should be 600)
- [ ] Token not revoked? (Check database or download fresh SDK)
- [ ] System time correct? (`date`)

### When to Download Fresh SDK

Download fresh SDK if:
- ✅ "Token expired" error
- ✅ "Invalid credentials" error
- ✅ Haven't used SDK in 90+ days
- ✅ Copied credentials between machines
- ✅ Suspect token theft/compromise

Don't download fresh SDK if:
- ❌ Normal operation (let rotation work)
- ❌ Every debug session (use API keys for debugging)
