---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Vision & Strategy Documentation

**Created: [AIM_VISION.md](./AIM_VISION.md)**
- **Mission Statement**: AIM as complete AIVF rebuild targeting investment
- **Investment-Ready Criteria**: 7 key metrics investors look for
- **Current Status**: 35/60+ endpoints (58% complete)
- **Roadmap**: 4-phase plan from Foundation → Investment Readiness
- **Revenue Model**: Community ($0), Pro ($99/mo), Enterprise ($999/mo)
- **Success Metrics**: Technical, User, Business, Investment targets
- **Competitive Advantages**: vs. AIVF and competitors (Auth0, Okta)

**Key Highlights**:
- **60+ endpoints needed** (not exactly 60 - corrected as you mentioned)
- **Missing features identified**: MCP registration (8), Security dashboard (6), Compliance (5), Analytics (4), Webhooks (2)
- **Clear path to $2M seed round** within 6 months

### 2. System Architecture Documentation

**Created: [architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](./architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
- **High-Level Architecture Diagram**: Client → Load Balancer → Backend → Data Layer
- **Component Breakdown**: Frontend, Backend, Database, Security layers
- **Technology Stack Tables**: Complete tech stack with versions and purposes
- **Architecture Patterns**: Clean Architecture, Multi-Tenancy, Trust Scoring
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Authentication, Agent Registration, Trust Calculation
- **Security Architecture**: 4-layer authentication (OAuth, JWT, API Keys, RBAC)
- **Scalability Strategy**: Horizontal scaling, performance targets, caching
- **Deployment Architecture**: Development (Docker Compose) and Production (Kubernetes)

### 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Created **5 comprehensive ADRs** following industry best practices:

#### **[ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection](./architecture/adr/001-technology-stack-selection.md)**
- **Decision**: Go 1.23 + Fiber v3, Next.js 15 + React 19, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7
- **Rationale**: 10x performance vs Python, modern frameworks, enterprise-ready
- **Alternatives Considered**: Python/FastAPI, Node.js, Rust, Java (all rejected)
- **Consequences**: Positive (performance, scalability), Negative (learning curve)

#### **[ADR-002: Clean Architecture Pattern](./architecture/adr/002-clean-architecture-pattern.md)**
- **Decision**: Domain-Driven Design with 4 layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Interfaces)
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward (Interfaces → Application → Domain)
- **Code Examples**: Complete implementation examples for each layer
- **Testing Benefits**: Domain layer testable with zero dependencies
- **Alternatives Considered**: MVC, Microservices, Modular Monolith (all rejected)

#### **[ADR-003: Multi-Tenancy Strategy](./architecture/adr/003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md)**
- **Decision**: Shared Schema with PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Implementation**: Every table has `organization_id`, RLS policies enforce isolation
- **Security**: Database-level enforcement prevents data leaks even if app has bugs
- **Performance**: Composite indexes `(organization_id, other_columns)` for fast queries
- **Compliance**: Meets SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR requirements
- **Alternatives Considered**: Separate Databases, Separate Schemas, Sharding (all rejected)

#### **[ADR-004: Trust Scoring Algorithm](./architecture/adr/004-trust-scoring-algorithm.md)**
- **Decision**: 8-Factor ML-Powered Trust Scoring (0-100 scale)
- **Factors**: Verification (30%), Security Audits (20%), Community Trust (15%), Uptime (15%), Incidents (10%), Compliance (5%), Activity (3%), Recency (2%)
- **Transparency**: Users see factor breakdown and can improve scores
- **Implementation**: Complete Go code with all factor calculations
- **Algorithm Versioning**: Support for future algorithm improvements
- **Alternatives Considered**: Binary (Verified/Not), Pure ML, Manual Curation (all rejected)

#### **[ADR-005: API Authentication & Authorization](./architecture/adr/005-api-authentication-authorization.md)**
- **Decision**: Multi-layer auth strategy (OAuth2/OIDC, JWT, API Keys, RBAC)
- **OAuth Flow**: Google, Microsoft, Okta with Authorization Code + PKCE
- **JWT Tokens**: Access (24h) + Refresh (7d) with rotation
- **API Keys**: SHA-256 hashed, expiration tracking, usage monitoring
- **RBAC**: 4 roles (Admin, Manager, Member, Viewer) with permission matrix
- **Security Checklist**: 10 security requirements all met
- **Alternatives Considered**: Session-based, Basic Auth, OAuth1 (all rejected)

### 4. Architecture Documentation Index

**Created: [architecture/README.md](./architecture/README.md)**
- **Documentation Index**: Links to all architecture docs and ADRs
- **System Overview**: High-level architecture diagram and component table
- **Design Principles**: Security-First, Clean Architecture, Performance, Scalability, Observability
- **Current Status**: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress
