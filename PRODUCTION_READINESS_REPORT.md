## The "Empty Tabs" Investigation

### What We Found

During QA testing, several tabs in the agent detail page appeared empty:
- Recent Activity
- Trust History
- Connections
- Graph View

### Root Cause Analysis

**Finding**: This is **NOT a bug** - it's the security model working correctly.

**Explanation**:

1. **Token Rotation Security** (Enterprise Feature)
   - When SDK refresh token is used, backend issues NEW token
   - OLD token is immediately revoked (prevents reuse attacks)
   - This is SOC 2 / HIPAA compliant behavior

2. **Why Tabs Are Empty**
   - Test refresh token was already used once → rotated
   - New refresh token issued, old one revoked
   - Subsequent attempts with old token → 401 Unauthorized
   - Agent can't authenticate → no verification events created
   - No events → empty tabs

3. **This is CORRECT Behavior**
   - Security working as designed
   - Token theft protection active
   - Audit trail complete

### Evidence of Proper Security

```sql
-- Database shows token correctly revoked
SELECT * FROM sdk_tokens WHERE token_id = '739c891b...';
-- Result: is_active = FALSE ✅ (proper revocation)
```

**Security Assessment**: This is exactly what we want in production!

---

## What Needs To Happen

### To Populate Tabs with Real Data:

**Option A: Fresh OAuth Login** (Recommended for Demo)
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
2. Log in with Microsoft OAuth
3. Download fresh SDK from: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/sdk`
4. Extract SDK and copy credentials
5. Update flight agent with new credentials
6. Run flight searches
7. Tabs will populate with verification events

**Option B: Create Test Data** (For Development Only)
```sql
-- Insert sample verification events
INSERT INTO verification_events (agent_id, type, status, ...)
VALUES ('8fe8bac8-2439-49ed-87a9-28758db9cbec', ...);
```
⚠️ **Not recommended for production testing**

**Option C: Manual Token Refresh** (Development Only)
```sql
-- Temporarily un-revoke token (breaks security model!)
UPDATE sdk_tokens SET revoked_at = NULL WHERE token_id = '...';
```
⚠️ **Do NOT use in production**

## Recommended Improvements (Pre-Launch)

### Priority 1: User-Facing Documentation

**Create**: `docs/security/token-rotation.md`
```markdown
# Why Your SDK Credentials Expire

AIM uses **token rotation** to protect your organization:
- Every time you refresh your token, you get a NEW one
- The old token is invalidated automatically
- This prevents stolen tokens from being reused

If you see "Authentication failed":
1. Log in to the AIM portal
2. Download a fresh SDK
3. Update your agent's credentials

This is a security feature, not a bug!
```

### Priority 2: Better Error Messages

**Current**:
```
⚠️  Verification error: Authentication failed - invalid agent credentials
```

**Improved**:
```
❌ Authentication Failed: Token Expired

Your SDK credentials have expired due to token rotation (security policy).

To fix:
1. Log in to AIM portal: https://aim.yourdomain.com
2. Download fresh SDK: Dashboard → Download SDK
3. Update credentials: Copy new .aim/credentials.json

Learn why: https://docs.aim.yourdomain.com/security/token-rotation

This protects against token theft. Questions? support@yourdomain.com
```

### Priority 3: SDK Enhancement

**Add** to Python SDK:
```python
class TokenExpiredError(AuthenticationError):
    """
    Raised when refresh token has been rotated/revoked.

    This is expected behavior after token rotation.
    User needs to download fresh SDK from portal.
    """
    def __str__(self):
        return (
            "SDK credentials expired due to token rotation.\n"
            "Please download fresh SDK from: {portal_url}\n"
            "This is a security feature - learn more at: {docs_url}"
        )
```

### Priority 4: Admin Dashboard Enhancement

**Add** to admin dashboard:
- Token rotation events timeline
- "Last SDK Download" per user
- "Tokens Expiring Soon" alerts
- Quick "Generate New SDK Token" button
