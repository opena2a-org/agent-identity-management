# AIM Secrets Management Strategy 🔐

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Purpose**: Define clear separation between free key management and premium secrets management
**Goal**: Avoid feature overlap that cannibalizes premium revenue

---

## 🎯 Strategic Question

**Should we keep these endpoints in MVP (free tier)?**
1. ❓ `GET /agents/:id/key-vault` - Agent cryptographic key information
2. ❓ `GET/POST /agents/:id/api-keys` - Agent-scoped API keys

**Concern**: Will these interfere with **Premium Secrets Management** feature?

---

## 💎 Premium Secrets Management (Future Feature)

### What Premium Secrets Management Should Offer

**Premium Feature**: **Vault-as-a-Service for Agent Secrets** 💰
**Target Customers**: Enterprises that don't want to manage secrets themselves
**Pricing**: Pro ($199/mo) or Enterprise ($499/mo)

#### Premium Features (NOT in Community Edition)
```
💎 Centralized Secrets Vault (HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager integration)
   - Store API keys, database passwords, OAuth tokens
   - Automatic rotation of third-party secrets (AWS, Stripe, OpenAI keys)
   - Encrypted storage with envelope encryption
   - Secret versioning and rollback

💎 Dynamic Secrets Generation
   - Generate temporary database credentials on-demand
   - Auto-expiring AWS IAM credentials
   - Time-limited API tokens

💎 Secret Injection at Runtime
   - Inject secrets into agent environment variables
   - SDK auto-fetches secrets without storing them
   - Zero-trust secret delivery

💎 Secret Compliance & Auditing
   - Who accessed which secret when
   - Secret usage tracking and anomaly detection
   - Automatic secret rotation policies (30/60/90 days)

💎 Multi-Cloud Secret Sync
   - Sync secrets across AWS/Azure/GCP
   - Cross-region secret replication
   - Disaster recovery for secrets

💎 Secret Scanning & Leak Detection
   - Scan agent code for hardcoded secrets
   - GitHub secret leak detection
   - Automatic secret revocation on leak
```

**Value Proposition**:
- **"Never manage secrets again"** - We handle rotation, encryption, compliance
- **Save 20+ hours/month** on secret management tasks
- **Prevent breaches** from hardcoded/leaked secrets

## 🆓 Community Edition (Free Tier)

### What Should Be FREE (No Overlap with Premium)

#### ✅ KEEP: `GET /agents/:id/key-vault` (SAFE - No Premium Overlap)

**What It Shows** (Free):
```json
{
  "public_key": "MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",       // ✅ FREE - Just displays public key
  "key_algorithm": "Ed25519",                // ✅ FREE - Algorithm info
  "key_created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",  // ✅ FREE - Creation timestamp
  "key_expires_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",  // ✅ FREE - Expiration date
  "rotation_count": 3,                       // ✅ FREE - How many times rotated
  "has_previous_public_key": true            // ✅ FREE - Grace period status
}
```

**What It DOESN'T Show** (Reserved for Premium):
```
❌ Private key storage (never shown, but Premium vault stores it securely)
❌ Third-party API keys (Stripe, OpenAI, AWS) - Premium only
❌ Database passwords - Premium only
❌ OAuth tokens - Premium only
❌ Automatic secret rotation - Premium only
❌ Secret injection at runtime - Premium only
```

**Why Keep in Free Tier**:
- Only shows **AIM-generated Ed25519 keypair** (used for agent verification)
- Does NOT store/manage third-party secrets
- Developers need visibility into key expiration for compliance
- No conflict with Premium because Premium manages DIFFERENT secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)

**Premium Upsell Path**:
```

```

**Verdict**: ✅ **KEEP in Community Edition** - No conflict, shows upsell opportunity

---

#### ⚠️ REMOVE: `GET/POST /agents/:id/api-keys` (CONFLICTS with Premium)

**Why This DOES Conflict with Premium**:

**Free Tier Capability** (Current):
```
✅ Create agent-scoped API keys for AIM API access
✅ List agent's AIM API keys
✅ Revoke agent's AIM API keys
```

**Premium Capability** (Future):
```
💎 Store third-party API keys (Stripe, OpenAI, AWS)
💎 Auto-rotate third-party secrets
💎 Inject secrets at runtime
💎 Secret leak detection
```

**The Problem**: If Community Edition already has "Agent API Keys" tab, enterprises will think:
- "Why do I need Premium secrets management if I already have API keys tab?"
- "I can just store my Stripe keys in the free tier API keys"
- Confusing UX - two different "API Keys" concepts

**The Solution**: **REMOVE from Community Edition**

**Alternative for Free Users**:
- Use **Organization API Keys** (already exists at `/api/v1/api-keys`)
- Organization keys work for ALL agents (good enough for free tier)
- Premium provides agent-scoped keys as part of secrets management

**Premium Positioning**:
```
Community Edition:
  ✅ Organization-wide API keys (access all agents)
  ❌ No agent-scoped API keys
  ❌ No third-party secret storage

Premium Edition:
  💎 Agent-scoped API keys (principle of least privilege)
  💎 Third-party secret vault (Stripe, OpenAI, AWS keys)
  💎 Automatic secret rotation
  💎 Runtime secret injection
  💎 Secret leak detection
```

**Verdict**: ❌ **REMOVE from Community Edition** - Conflicts with premium positioning

---

## 📊 Final Recommendation

### ✅ KEEP in MVP (Community Edition)

| Endpoint | Reason | Premium Conflict? |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| `GET /agents/:id/violations` | Critical security monitoring | ❌ No conflict |
| `GET /agents/:id/key-vault` | Shows AIM-generated keypair only | ❌ No conflict |

**Total MVP Endpoints**: 2 new UI components needed
**Implementation Time**: 4-6 hours (violations tab + key vault tab)

---

### ❌ REMOVE from MVP (Move to Premium)

| Endpoint | Reason | Premium Conflict? |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| `GET /agents/:id/api-keys` | Confusing with premium secrets vault | ✅ YES - Conflicts |
| `POST /agents/:id/api-keys` | Creates agent-scoped keys (premium feature) | ✅ YES - Conflicts |

**Replacement for Free Users**: Use organization-wide API keys (`/api/v1/api-keys`)

---

### 📅 ADD TO ROADMAP (Future v1.1+)

| Feature | Reason | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Bulk Remove MCPs button | Low priority, nice-to-have | v1.1 (Q2 2025) |
| Trust Score Trends page | Analytics, not critical | v1.1 (Q2 2025) |
| Agent-scoped API Keys | Part of Premium Secrets Management | Premium tier |

```

**Value Proposition**: **"Never manage secrets again"**

---

## 💼 Premium Sales Pitch Example

**Community User**: "I love AIM for agent verification, but managing my agents' Stripe and OpenAI keys is a pain. I have to rotate them manually every 90 days for compliance."

**AIM Sales**: "That's exactly what our Premium Secrets Management is for! For $199/month, we'll:
- Store all your third-party secrets in an encrypted vault
- Automatically rotate them every 30/60/90 days
- Inject them into your agents at runtime (no hardcoding)
- Alert you if any secrets are leaked
- Generate compliance reports for SOC 2 audits

You'll save 20+ hours/month and never have a secret leak incident again."

**Result**: Premium conversion 💰

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP Cleanup (Now)
**Timeline**: 1 day

1. ✅ **REMOVE** Agent API Keys endpoints
   - Delete `GET /agents/:id/api-keys` handler
   - Delete `POST /agents/:id/api-keys` handler
   - Remove from API docs

2. ✅ **KEEP** Key Vault endpoint
   - `GET /agents/:id/key-vault` stays
   - Add premium upsell banner to UI tab

3. ✅ **KEEP** Violations endpoint
   - `GET /agents/:id/violations` stays
   - Critical for security monitoring

---

### Phase 2: MVP UI Implementation (Next)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days

1. ✅ Build **Violations Tab** (3-4 hours)
   - Table showing capability violations
   - Severity badges (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Filter by date, severity
   - Export to CSV

2. ✅ Build **Key Vault Tab** (2-3 hours)
   - Display public key (with copy button)
   - Show expiration date with countdown
   - Rotation history
   - **Premium upsell banner** for managed secrets

---

### Phase 3: Roadmap (Future)
**Timeline**: After MVP launch

1. 📅 **v1.1 - Nice-to-have features**

## 📈 Revenue Impact Analysis

### Without Clear Separation (Bad)
```
Community Edition has agent-scoped API keys
→ Users think: "I already have API key management"
→ Premium value unclear
→ Low conversion rate (2-3%)
→ Revenue: $50K/year
```

### With Clear Separation (Good)
```
Community Edition: Basic identity management
Premium Edition: Full secrets vault + automation
→ Users think: "I need secrets management for my Stripe/AWS keys"
→ Clear premium value proposition
→ High conversion rate (8-10%)
→ Revenue: $200K+/year
```

**Potential Revenue Increase**: **+$150K/year** by having clear premium features

---

## 🎯 Final Verdict

### Keep in MVP (Free)
1. ✅ `GET /agents/:id/violations` - Security monitoring
2. ✅ `GET /agents/:id/key-vault` - AIM keypair visibility

### Remove from MVP (Move to Premium)
3. ❌ `GET /agents/:id/api-keys` - Conflicts with premium vault
4. ❌ `POST /agents/:id/api-keys` - Conflicts with premium vault

### Defer to v1.1 (Nice-to-have)
5. 📅 Bulk Remove MCPs button
6. 📅 Trust Score Trends page
