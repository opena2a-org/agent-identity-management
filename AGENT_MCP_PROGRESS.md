## What We Fixed & Delivered Today

### 1. **Python SDK Demo & Sample Agent** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Developers had no easy way to test the Python SDK or understand how to integrate it with their agents.

**What We Fixed:**
- Created a complete Python sample agent (`sample-agent-python/`) with one-line registration
- Built comprehensive SDK implementation with Ed25519 cryptographic signing
- Added secure credential storage using system keyring
- Integrated OAuth/OIDC authentication (Google, Microsoft, Okta)
- Implemented automatic MCP detection and capability discovery

**What Works Now:**
- Developers can run `python demo.py` and have a fully functional agent in seconds
- SDK automatically detects capabilities and registers MCP servers
- Complete examples for LangChain, CrewAI, and Microsoft Copilot integrations
- 18 test files covering all SDK features
- Production-ready Flask-based MCP server with cryptographic verification

---

### 2. **MCP Server Capabilities & Connected Agents** üîß

**Problem:** MCP servers in the dashboard showed no connected agents, no automatic capability detection, and were just basic data entry.

**What We Fixed:**
- Built database tables for tracking MCP detections and capabilities
- Implemented automatic agent-to-MCP relationship linking
- Created capability discovery that reads from MCP servers' `/.well-known/mcp/capabilities` endpoint
- Fixed URL parsing issues that prevented proper MCP server communication
- Added connected agents count and listing

**What Works Now:**
- MCP servers automatically detect their capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)
- Dashboard shows which agents are using which MCP servers
- Real-time capability metadata with versioning and schema support
- Automatic linking when agents report MCP usage
- Complete audit trail of all detection events

### 3. **Analytics Dashboard - Real Data** üìä

**Problem:** Analytics pages showed mock/dummy data instead of actual metrics from the database.

**What We Fixed:**
- Replaced all hardcoded values with real database queries
- Added support for flexible time periods (day, week, month, year)
- Fixed field name mapping issues between backend (camelCase) and frontend expectations
- Integrated real user counts, security metrics, and alert data
- Corrected agent name display in monitoring dashboard

**What Works Now:**
- `/dashboard/analytics/usage` shows real API calls, agent counts, data volume, uptime
- `/dashboard/monitoring` displays actual verification events with correct agent names
- `/dashboard/security` shows real-time security metrics with accurate event data
- All dashboards pull live data from PostgreSQL - zero mock data remaining

---

### 4. **Security Dashboard Data Accuracy** üîê

**Problem:** Security dashboard had hardcoded percentage changes, incorrect field mappings, and was showing "ID: undefined" for verification events.

**What We Fixed:**
- Removed all hardcoded percentage changes (like "+15.2%")
- Fixed all field name mismatches (agent_name ‚Üí agentName, agent_id ‚Üí agentId, etc.)
- Corrected status checking (result ‚Üí status)
- Integrated real user, alert, and security incident counts
- Added proper services (authService, alertService, securityService) to analytics handler

**What Works Now:**
- Security stats show real counts for users, alerts, critical alerts, and incidents
- Agent Action Verification events display correctly with agent names and IDs
- All verification events show proper initiator information, resource types, and timestamps
- No more dummy data - everything is live from the database

---

### 5. **Trust Score Calculation** üêõ

**Problem:** Average trust score displayed as "1%" when agents actually had 91% average trust.

**What We Fixed:**
- Identified rounding error: code was doing `Math.round(0.91)` = 1, then multiplying by 100 = 100%
- Changed calculation to multiply by 100 first, then round
- Now correctly shows 91% average trust score

**What Works Now:**
- Agent dashboard shows accurate trust score percentages
- Trust metrics are reliable for security monitoring
- No more misleading 1% display

---

### 6. **MCP Capability Auto-Detection** üéØ

**Problem:** Admin had to manually select capabilities when registering MCP servers.

**What We Fixed:**
- Removed manual capability selection UI
- Implemented automatic capability detection from MCP server endpoints
- Built proper URL parsing to handle different MCP server configurations
- Added capability grouping by type (tools, resources, prompts)
- Created detailed capability metadata display

**What Works Now:**
- Register an MCP server ‚Üí Click "Verify" ‚Üí Capabilities auto-detected
- Dashboard shows all tools, resources, and prompts grouped by type
- Capability schemas are stored and versioned
- Real-time capability verification and metadata updates
