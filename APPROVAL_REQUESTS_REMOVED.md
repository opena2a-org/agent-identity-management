# ✅ Approval Requests Feature Removed

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Reason**: Simplify product focus on core verification monitoring

## What Was Removed

### Backend:
- ❌ `apps/backend/internal/application/verification_service.go`
- ❌ `apps/backend/internal/infrastructure/repository/verification_repository.go`
- ❌ `apps/backend/internal/interfaces/http/handlers/verification_handler.go`
- ❌ Database table `approval_requests` (via migration 012)
- ❌ All `/api/v1/verifications` endpoints

### Frontend:
- ❌ `apps/web/app/dashboard/verifications/` page
- ❌ `apps/web/components/modals/verification-detail-modal.tsx`
- ❌ Sidebar link to "Verifications"

### Documentation:
- ❌ `APPROVAL_REQUESTS_EXPLAINED.md`

---

## What Was Kept (AIVF-Style Verification Monitoring)

### Backend ✅:
- ✅ `verification_events` table (migration 011)
- ✅ `VerificationEventRepository` - Real-time event storage
- ✅ `VerificationEventService` - Auto-logging service
- ✅ `VerificationEventHandler` - API endpoints
- ✅ All `/api/v1/verification-events` endpoints

### Documentation ✅:
- ✅ `VERIFICATION_MONITORING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete spec
- ✅ `VERIFICATION_MONITORING_BACKEND_COMPLETE.md` - Backend summary

## Why This Change?

**Problem with Approval Requests**:
1. **Cannot enforce access control** on external resources
2. **Requires application integration** to be useful
3. **Confusing naming** - overlapped with verification monitoring
4. **Added complexity** without clear standalone value

**Solution**:
- Remove approval requests entirely
- Focus on **automatic verification monitoring** (AIVF-style)
- Clear product positioning: Real-time security analytics, not access control

---

## Database Migration

Migration 012 removes the `approval_requests` table:

```sql
-- Up migration
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS approval_requests CASCADE;

-- Down migration (if rollback needed)
-- Recreates table structure
```

To apply:
```bash
cd apps/backend
go run cmd/migrate/main.go up
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend cleanup complete
2. ⏳ Frontend: Build verification monitoring dashboard
3. ⏳ Testing: End-to-end verification system

---

## Summary

**Removed**: Manual approval workflow (approval_requests)
**Kept**: Automatic verification monitoring (verification_events)
**Benefit**: Simplified product with clear focus on real-time security analytics

The product now focuses on what it does best:
- ✅ Real-time cryptographic verification logging
- ✅ Security analytics and dashboards
- ✅ Trust scoring and agent monitoring
- ✅ Compliance audit trails
