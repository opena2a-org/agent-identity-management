## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: 1.23 or higher
- **Node.js**: 18 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: 16 or higher
- **Docker**: (optional) for containerized development
- **Git**: for version control

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-identity-management.git
   cd agent-identity-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies
   cd apps/backend
   go mod download

   # Frontend dependencies
   cd ../web
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Database**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker Compose (recommended)
   docker compose up -d postgres

   # Run migrations
   cd apps/backend
   go run cmd/server/main.go migrate
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
   # Edit .env with your configuration

   # Frontend
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

5. **Run Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd apps/backend
   go run cmd/server/main.go

   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   cd apps/web
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/swagger

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**Go Backend**:
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `go vet` and `golint` before committing
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

**TypeScript/React Frontend**:
- Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines
- Use functional components over class components
- Keep components small and focused

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

**Backend**:
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support for Microsoft
fix(api): resolve race condition in token refresh
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(agents): add integration tests for agent registration
```

## Tag conventions

This repository ships multiple independently versioned artifacts (the platform itself and three language SDKs). Tags use per-package prefixes so each artifact has its own release timeline and so the release workflow can filter cleanly.

| Artifact | Tag prefix | Example | Source of truth for version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform (backend + frontend release artifacts) | `platform-v` | `platform-v1.0.0` | release commit |
| Python SDK | `sdk-py-v` | `sdk-py-v1.23.0` | `sdk/python/VERSION` |
| TypeScript SDK | `sdk-ts-v` | `sdk-ts-v1.0.0` | `sdk/typescript/package.json` |
| Java SDK | `sdk-java-v` | `sdk-java-v1.0.0` | `sdk/java/VERSION` and `sdk/java/pom.xml` |

**Bare `v<X.Y.Z>` tags are retired for new releases.** Historical bare tags from `v0.2.0` through `v1.23.0` remain in the tag history as immutable artifacts — they were de-facto Python SDK releases despite the ambiguous naming, and removing them would break external references. Do not create new bare-`v*` tags.

**Cutting a release:**

```bash
# Platform (example: cutting 1.0.0)
git tag -a platform-v1.0.0 -m "Platform v1.0.0"
git push origin platform-v1.0.0

# Python SDK (example: cutting 1.23.0)
git tag -a sdk-py-v1.23.0 -m "Python SDK v1.23.0"
git push origin sdk-py-v1.23.0
```

The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow currently filters on `platform-v*` and generates SBOMs on each platform tag push. Per-SDK publishing workflows (PyPI, npm, Maven Central) will be added under their own tag prefixes in follow-up work; until those land, SDK tags only mark the release point in git history.
