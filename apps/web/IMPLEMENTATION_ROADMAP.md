# AIM Platform - Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines what needs to be built to transform the current AIM platform from a functional dashboard into a complete enterprise-grade runtime verification system. The implementation is prioritized into three tiers based on business value and user impact.

**Current State Analysis**:
- ✅ Basic dashboard with mock data
- ✅ Agent registry page with stats
- ✅ Security dashboard with threat visualization
- ✅ Verifications page with filtering
- ✅ MCP servers page with status tracking
- ✅ Admin dashboard with basic metrics

**Gap Analysis**:
- ❌ No interactive modals for creating/editing resources
- ❌ No real-time verification workflow
- ❌ No search/filter functionality (display only)
- ❌ No export/reporting capabilities
- ❌ No alert/notification system
- ❌ No API key management page
- ❌ No onboarding/first-time user experience
- ❌ No detail views for resources

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Backend API delays**
   - Mitigation: Start with mock APIs, swap to real later
   - Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for development

2. **Performance issues with large datasets**
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination early
   - Use virtual scrolling for large tables (react-window)

3. **Browser compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test on all major browsers weekly
   - Use autoprefixer for CSS compatibility

4. **Security vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Security audit before launch
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Penetration testing

### Business Risks
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict prioritization (use this roadmap)
   - Change control process

2. **Resource constraints**
   - Mitigation: Hire contractors if needed
   - Focus on Priority 1 first

3. **Deadline pressure**
   - Mitigation: Build buffer time
   - De-scope Priority 3 if needed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Set up project management**
   - Create Jira/Linear project
   - Import this roadmap as tasks
   - Assign priorities and owners

2. **Design system**
   - Create component library (if not exists)
   - Design modal templates
   - Create wireframes for new pages

3. **Backend coordination**
   - Review required API endpoints
   - Confirm backend team capacity
   - Create API contracts/specs

4. **Development environment**
   - Set up development branch
   - Configure linting/formatting
   - Set up testing framework

### Week 1 Sprint Plan
- [ ] Create sidebar navigation component
- [ ] Build agent registration modal (start)
- [ ] Implement search/filter hooks
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
- [ ] Backend: Implement verification endpoint

### Definition of Done (DoD)
For each feature to be considered "done":
- ✅ Code written and reviewed
- ✅ Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Integration tests written
- ✅ E2E test written (for user flows)
- ✅ Documented (code comments + user docs)
- ✅ Deployed to staging
- ✅ QA tested and approved
- ✅ Product owner accepted

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current state (functional dashboard with mock data) to a production-ready enterprise platform. By focusing on Priority 1 features first, we ensure the platform is usable and valuable. Priority 2 adds key functionality for production use, and Priority 3 enhances the user experience.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Start with Priority 1** - These are MVP blockers
2. **Build modals first** - Enables all CRUD operations
3. **Implement search/filter early** - Core usability feature
4. **Test as you go** - Don't defer testing
5. **Get user feedback** - After Priority 1, get real user testing
6. **Iterate based on usage** - Adjust Priority 2/3 based on user needs

With 2-3 frontend developers and 2-3 backend developers, this can be delivered in **10 weeks** with high quality. The platform will provide enterprises with complete visibility and control over their AI infrastructure, establishing trust through runtime verification.
