# AIM Platform - Executive Summary & Findings

## Overview

The Agent Identity Management (AIM) platform is a **runtime verification system** that enables enterprises to trust their AI infrastructure by verifying every AI agent action BEFORE execution. This document summarizes the comprehensive user research, workflow analysis, and implementation roadmap.

**Documents Created**:
1. `USER_WORKFLOWS.md` - Complete user personas and detailed workflows
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Technical implementation plan with priorities
