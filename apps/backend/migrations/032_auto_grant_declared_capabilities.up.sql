-- Migration: Auto-grant declared capabilities for existing agents
-- Date: 2025-10-11
-- Purpose: Backward compatibility - convert agent.capabilities to agent_capabilities records
--
-- This migration implements the new capability architecture:
-- - agent.capabilities (JSONB array) = DECLARED capabilities (reference only)
-- - agent_capabilities (table) = GRANTED capabilities (enforcement source of truth)
--
-- For existing agents with declared capabilities but no granted capabilities,
-- we auto-grant their declared capabilities to maintain backward compatibility.

-- Auto-grant declared capabilities for existing agents
