# üó∫Ô∏è AIM Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

This document tracks future enhancements and features that are deferred from the current development cycle.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy Enforcement (Post-MVP)

### Current Status (MVP)
‚úÖ **Capability Violation Detection** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- Actively enforced on all agent API calls
- Creates security alerts for violations
- Blocks unauthorized actions in real-time
- Prevents EchoLeak-style attacks (CVE-2025-32711)

### Planned Security Policy Enforcers

---

### Trust Score Policy Enforcement
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Planned (Phase 1)
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours

**Current**: Trust scores are calculated and displayed, but not enforced
**Needed**: Automatic enforcement when trust scores fall below thresholds

**Policies to Enforce**:
- Low Trust Score Alert (threshold: 70, action: alert_only)
- Critical Trust Score Block (threshold: 50, action: block_and_alert)

**Implementation**:
- Add `EvaluateTrustScore()` method to `SecurityPolicyService`
- Call after every trust score update in `AgentService`
- Create alerts for low scores
- Automatically disable agents with critical scores
- Send notifications to administrators

**Use Case**: Proactive threat detection based on agent behavior changes

---

### Failed Authentication Monitoring
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Planned (Phase 2)
**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours

**Current**: Auth failures are logged but not tracked or enforced
**Needed**: Account lockout and alerts for repeated failures

**Policy to Enforce**:
- Failed Authentication Monitoring (max_attempts: 5, time_window: 15m, lockout: 30m)

**Implementation**:
- Add failed attempt counter per agent/user
- Add `EvaluateAuthFailures()` method
- Implement temporary account lockout
- Create alerts for suspicious patterns
- Send email notifications for lockouts
- Admin dashboard to unlock accounts

**Use Case**: Prevent brute force attacks and credential stuffing

---

### Unusual Activity Detection
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Planned (Phase 3)
**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours

**Current**: Agent API calls are logged but no anomaly detection
**Needed**: Real-time detection of unusual behavior patterns

**Policy to Enforce**:
- Unusual Activity Monitoring (api_rate_threshold: 1000, time_window: 1h, check_off_hours: true)

**Implementation**:
- Add middleware to track API call rates
- Implement baseline behavior profiling per agent
- Add `EvaluateUnusualActivity()` method
- Detect API rate spikes
- Detect off-hours access patterns
- Create alerts for anomalies
- Optional blocking of suspicious activity

**Use Case**: Detect compromised agents or malicious behavior

---

### Data Exfiltration Detection
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Planned (Phase 3)
**Estimated Effort**: 8 hours

**Current**: No tracking of data transfers or response sizes
**Needed**: Detection and prevention of large-scale data exfiltration

**Policy to Enforce**:
- Data Exfiltration Detection (data_threshold_mb: 100, time_window: 1h)

**Implementation**:
- Add response size tracking middleware
- Track cumulative data transfer per agent
- Add `EvaluateDataExfiltration()` method
- Detect large data transfers
- Detect unusual download patterns
- Create alerts for suspicious transfers
- Optional blocking of exfiltration attempts
- Log destination IPs/domains

**Use Case**: Prevent data breaches and insider threats

---

### Phase Timeline

**Phase 2** (Post-MVP, Week 2):
- Failed Authentication Monitoring

**Phase 3** (Post-MVP, Weeks 3-4):

- Data Exfiltration Detection
- End-to-end security testing
- Performance optimization

**Total Estimated Effort**: 20 hours across 4 weeks
