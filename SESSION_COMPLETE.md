## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### ADR-006: Runtime Verification & Capability-Based Authorization

**Problem AIM Solves**:
- Enterprises don't trust AI agents because they can't see what they're doing
- Agents can drift from authorized capabilities and become security risks
- No audit trail of AI/MCP activities
- Security teams blind to AI-related threats

**AIM's Solution**:
```
1. REGISTRATION
   Employee registers agent ‚Üí Defines capabilities ‚Üí AIM stores

2. RUNTIME VERIFICATION (Before Every Action)
   Agent requests action ‚Üí AIM verifies against capabilities ‚Üí Allow/Deny

3. AUDIT TRAIL
   AIM logs all verifications ‚Üí Security dashboard ‚Üí Compliance reports
```

**Capability Schema**:
- File operations (read/write permissions, allowed paths, max file size)
- Code execution (allowed languages)
- Network access (allowed/forbidden domains)
- Database access (allowed databases, query types, forbidden tables)
- Rate limits (per minute/hour)
- Business hours restrictions

**Key Innovation**:
Every AI agent/MCP action is verified BEFORE execution, creating complete audit trail and preventing capability drift.

## üîß Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Understanding AIM's Core Mission
**Problem**: Initially misunderstood AIM as just a registration platform
**Solution**: User clarified that AIM is a runtime verification platform - every agent/MCP action must be verified BEFORE execution
**Result**: Created ADR-006 documenting the complete architecture

### Challenge 2: Missing Runtime Verification Endpoints
**Problem**: First subagent implemented CRUD operations but missed the CORE verification endpoints
**Solution**: Created second subagent specifically to add runtime verification
**Result**: Added 3 critical endpoints for pre-execution authorization

### Challenge 3: Frontend UI Not Enterprise-Grade
**Problem**: Multiple redesign attempts failed to match AIVF quality
**Solution**: Identified Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issue - downgraded to v3.4
**Result**: Professional, enterprise-grade dashboard with proper styling

### Challenge 4: Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility
**Problem**: `@apply` directives not working, CSS had only 12 rules instead of 2000+
**Solution**: Downgraded from Tailwind v4.1.14 to v3.4.0, fixed PostCSS config
**Result**: Full Tailwind utilities available, proper CSS compilation

## üìã Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Run database migrations**: Execute the migrations created by subagents
2. **Connect frontend to API**: Replace mock data with real API calls
3. **Deploy to staging**: Test the complete system end-to-end
4. **Performance testing**: Verify <50ms verification latency target

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
1. **Implement full capability matching**: Currently simplified - needs resource-level checks
2. **Build SDK libraries**: Python and TypeScript SDKs for easy integration
3. **Add real-time updates**: WebSocket for live verification feed
4. **Create demo video**: Show the runtime verification flow in action

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
1. **Beta testing**: 5-10 enterprise customers
2. **ML anomaly detection**: Enhance beyond simple capability matching
3. **Performance optimization**: Cache capability checks, edge deployment
4. **Security audit**: Third-party penetration testing

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Runtime Verification is AIM's Differentiator
The CORE value proposition is not just registering agents - it's verifying EVERY action BEFORE execution. This is what enterprises need to trust AI.

### 2. Capability Schema is Critical
The granular capability schema (file paths, query types, rate limits, business hours) gives enterprises precise control over what AI can do.

### 3. Audit Trail Drives Compliance
Complete logging of all verification requests enables SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliance automatically.

### 4. UI Quality Matters for Investors
Enterprise-grade UI signals technical competence and product maturity to investors.
