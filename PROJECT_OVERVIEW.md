# Agent Identity Management - Enterprise Agent & MCP Identity Management Platform

## Part of the OpenA2A Ecosystem
**Domain**: opena2a.org
**Product**: Agent Identity Management (first product in the OpenA2A suite)

## What is OpenA2A?
**Open Agent-to-Agent** (OpenA2A) is the open-source ecosystem for secure, verified, and trusted AI agent and MCP server interactions. Our mission is to bring enterprise-grade security, identity management, and governance to the rapidly growing agent-to-agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystems.

## Vision
The definitive open-source platform for:
- **AI Agent Identity Management**: Verify and manage identities of autonomous AI agents
- **MCP Server Verification**: Cryptographic verification of MCP servers
- **Agent-to-Agent Security**: Secure communications between agents
- **Trust & Governance**: Enterprise-grade trust scoring and compliance

## Why "OpenA2A"?
- **Open**: Open-source, transparent, community-driven
- **A2A**: Agent-to-Agent - the future of AI interactions
- **Scope**: Covers AI agents, MCP servers, and all agent-based systems

## Problem Statement
Organizations deploying AI agents and MCP servers face critical challenges:
1. **Identity Chaos**: No standardized way to verify agent/MCP authenticity
2. **Security Gaps**: No protection against malicious or compromised agents
3. **Trust Issues**: No way to assess agent/MCP trustworthiness
4. **Compliance Blind Spots**: No audit trails or compliance reporting
5. **A2A Communication Risks**: Agents talking to agents with no governance

## Solution: Agent Identity Management
Enterprise-grade platform providing:
- **Identity Verification**: Cryptographic verification of AI agents and MCP servers
- **Trust Scoring**: ML-powered trust assessment based on behavior
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained SSO integration with auto-provisioning

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture
```
cmd/
  identity-server/      # Main identity server
  cli/                  # CLI tool
internal/
  domain/              # Business logic (pure, no dependencies)
  application/         # Use cases (orchestration)
  infrastructure/      # External dependencies (DB, cache, etc.)
  interfaces/          # HTTP handlers, gRPC services
pkg/                   # Shared libraries
```

### 2. Domain-Driven Design
- Clear bounded contexts (Identity, Security, Compliance, Observability)
- Ubiquitous language (Trust Score, Verification Event, Security Incident)
- Aggregate roots (Agent, MCPServer, Organization, User)

### 3. API-First Development
