To fix this issue:
  1. Log in to AIM portal: {portal_url}/auth/login

Why does this happen?
  AIM uses token rotation for enterprise security:

  ‚Ä¢ OLD token is immediately revoked ‚Üí prevents token theft
  ‚Ä¢ This is SOC 2 / HIPAA compliant behavior

This security measure protects your organization from unauthorized access."""
