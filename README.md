# 🛡️ Agent Identity Management

**Enterprise-grade identity verification and security platform for AI agents and MCP servers.**

Part of the [OpenA2A](https://opena2a.org) (Open Agent-to-Agent) ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 What is Agent Identity Management?

Agent Identity Management is the first open-source platform designed specifically for:
- ✅ **AI Agent Identity Management**: Verify and manage autonomous AI agent identities
- ✅ **MCP Server Verification**: Cryptographic verification of Model Context Protocol servers
- ✅ **Trust Scoring**: ML-powered assessment of agent/MCP trustworthiness
- ✅ **Enterprise SSO**: Google, Microsoft, Okta integration with auto-provisioning
- ✅ **Security Monitoring**: Proactive alerts for threats and anomalies
- ✅ **Compliance**: Comprehensive audit trails and reporting

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opena2a/identity.git
cd identity

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Open your browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

### For Developers Building This
**New Claude Code session command**:
```
cd /Users/decimai/workspace/agent-identity-management
Please start building Agent Identity Management and use git as you see fit
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Read `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` for full context
2. Follow `30_HOUR_BUILD_PLAN.md` hour by hour
3. Build complete enterprise platform in 30 hours
4. Commit progress frequently to git
